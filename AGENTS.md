# Morpheus — agent instructions

Read this before doing anything. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file so Claude and Codex
read the same instructions.

## What this repo is

Morpheus scaffolds new company repositories and maintains the reusable packages they depend
on. Read [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md) before making structural changes — it is the
specification, and it is more current than the code.

This repo is `kind: internal`. It has `hq/product/` and nothing else under `hq/` — no brand,
marketing, finance, or support, because Morpheus is a tool, not a company.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `architecture.md` | The specification. Update it when a decision changes. |
| `src/pm/` | Project management: schemas, parser, index generator |
| `src/cli/` | The `morpheus` command |
| `hq/product/` | Morpheus's own roadmap and goals — it eats its own dog food |
| `.github/workflows/` | Reusable workflows called by every project |
| `docs/runbooks/` | Operational steps a human performs — consoles, DNS, keys |
| `.github/agent-review-prompt.md` | The rung-2 reviewer persona — versioned, so it is reviewable |
| `.claude/skills/` | Named, repeatable procedures — `voice-handoff`, `voice-import` |
| `local/handoffs/` | Handoff docs, both directions. Gitignored — never committed |
| `qa/acceptance/` | Acceptance criteria per item, named by `RoadmapItem.acceptance` |
| `tests/` | Vitest, mirroring `src/` |
| `.agent/worklog/` | What was attempted and learned per task, including dead ends |
| `.agent/decisions.md` | Settled choices and why — **read this first** |
| `.agent/inbox-archive/` | Past inbox cycles with replies, date-first |
| `hq/team/<handle>.md` | Live inboxes — one per person by GitHub handle |
| `hq/team/members.md` | The roster — handles, names, and how to work with each person |
| `hq/team/meeting-notes/` | Distilled meeting summaries, never transcripts |

```

## Device bootstrap

The checked-in `.morpheus/session-start.sh` shim detects a CLI that is missing or predates the
entire `self` command. When it or `morpheus context brief` reports that Morpheus is stale and
automatic updates are unconfigured, ask the user exactly: **"Morpheus is stale. Enable automatic
updates after pulls on this device?"** Do not infer consent.

- If the shim reports **Morpheus bootstrap required**, yes means
  `sh .morpheus/bootstrap.sh enable`; no means `sh .morpheus/bootstrap.sh disable`.
- Otherwise yes means `morpheus self auto-update enable`; no means
  `morpheus self auto-update disable`.

The legacy bootstrap never calls the installed `morpheus` binary. A yes clones reviewed current
`main`, installs that clone's reviewed lockfile, invokes its committed CLI directly, installs the
standalone package, registers the current project and installs the managed hooks. A no only records
the choice.

Consent installs managed `post-merge` and `post-rewrite` blocks in every registered Morpheus
project, beside rather than over any existing hook. Later pulls and rebases check the reviewed
Morpheus `main` commit and update through a disposable clone only when stale. Git deliberately does
not activate a hook delivered by the pull that contains it, so the checked-in session shim and
these instructions are the first-use bridge; no repository may silently turn consent on.

Before structural code discovery, run `morpheus codebase-memory install --check`. If it is not
operational, run `morpheus codebase-memory install` on the trusted device. The repair is
idempotent: it installs Morpheus's reviewed package pin when absent or at another version, configures supported local
agent clients, enables automatic indexing and watching, fully indexes this exact checkout, and
verifies the index against `HEAD`. A worktree needs its own exact-checkout index even when the main
clone is already indexed.

Installing codebase-memory is an explicit device action, never an npm lifecycle script or a
session-hook download.
Morpheus's global CLI is a self-contained copy, never a link to a source checkout or worktree.
`morpheus self check` compares its commit receipt to current `main`; `context brief` and `doctor`
surface the same drift. `morpheus self update` is the one-time/manual repair; consented Git hooks
call `morpheus self ensure` after later pulls and rebases. Both build in a disposable clone, install
the copy, and remove the clone without touching active work. The codebase-memory version stays
pinned until a reviewed Morpheus change advances it.

## Context freshness

Run `morpheus context brief` at session start if the standard hook did not run. It fetches the
canonical trunk and fast-forwards only a clean local trunk. It never rebases an active task or
rewrites dirty work. Follow its absolute `WORK IN` path when a session has a saved task association.
A behind checkout cannot issue a fresh receipt: integrate trunk explicitly, then re-read records.

**Read `.agent/decisions.md`, `.agent/learned.md` and `hq/team/<your handle>.md`, then:**

```sh
morpheus context refresh
```

This takes a *context receipt* — your assertion that you have loaded current project state,
fingerprinted against the tip of `origin/main`. It is good for **five minutes**, after which the
next governed command re-checks the trunk and those records rather than trusting the old verdict.

**Until you have one, these are refused:** `pm claim`, `pm new`, `pm link-issue`, `pm block`,
`access sync`. Nothing
else is gated — a check that fires on `pm index` trains you to route around it, and the
routing-around outlives the staleness.

```sh
morpheus context status    # what the current lease says, and how old it is
morpheus context check     # exit non-zero unless fresh — for hooks and scripts
morpheus context brief     # session start: fetches trunk, updates clean trunk, identifies task
morpheus context install   # wire the hooks that run `brief`, and declare the inbox
```

**`brief` runs by itself only where something is wired to run it.** Two files, one per
provider, both scaffolded by `morpheus init` and both repairable by `morpheus context install`:

| File | Read by |
|---|---|
| `.claude/settings.json` | Claude Code — `hooks.SessionStart` |
| `.codex/hooks.json` | Codex — the same schema, its own file |

`context install` is the path for a project that already exists, because `init` skips any file
already present — correct for a scaffold, and the reason six of eight projects had no hook months
after the protocol shipped. It merges rather than overwrites, is safe to re-run, and also declares
`context.handle` so `hq/team/<handle>.md` joins the required set. Without that declaration a
session certifies `fresh` having never opened the file a human replies in.

**Codex will not run an untrusted hook, and says nothing when it declines.** Once per project, run
`/hooks` in a Codex session and trust it. Trust is recorded against the hook's hash, so editing the
file means trusting it again — and until then `.codex/hooks.json` exists and does nothing, which
looks exactly like working.

**When something has moved**, `context refresh` prints what landed on the trunk and which records
changed. Re-read those and refresh again — the delta is the point, not the ceremony. **Do not
refresh without reading.** The receipt is your assertion, and a receipt taken to clear a gate is
the one failure mode the whole protocol cannot detect.

**Offline**, set `MORPHEUS_OFFLINE=1` — or pass `--offline`. Local work proceeds; anything that leaves the machine —
pushing a claim, granting access — stays refused, because an unverified trunk is exactly when you
should not be operating external controls. **`pm block` still works**: it writes the records and
skips the push, telling you the block is not visible to other sessions yet. Blocking rather than
guessing is the one escape hatch a stuck session needs most, so it is not the one to take away.

**On a fork**, set `"context": { "trunk": "upstream/main" }` in `morpheus.json`. `origin` is
your fork, whose `main` sits still while the real trunk moves — measured against it, a lease
certifies fresh forever. `morpheus doctor` reports a trunk that does not resolve.

Receipts live in `local/sessions/`, keyed by worktree, and are gitignored. A receipt says *this
working copy read these files*, which is true of one machine — committing it would turn a local
observation into a claim about everyone. Shared evidence stays the worklog, the commit and the PR.

Why it exists and what it is built against: [`architecture.md` §7.10](./architecture.md).

## Working conventions

**Claim work before starting it:**

```sh
morpheus pm claims           # what is already taken
morpheus pm claim MO-014     # stakes the branch on origin, sets in-progress, pushes
```

The remote branch **is** the claim — `pm claim` refuses if `origin` already has `mo-014-*`.

**Roadmap ids come from the clock** — `MO-26-08-01-15.26.34`, `PREFIX-YY-MM-DD-HH.MM.SS` in
**Pacific time on every machine**, not the author's local zone. A fixed zone is what makes ids
from different contributors comparable; a local one silently reorders the board the moment two
people are in different places.
No remote is consulted because none can help: a fork contributor's `origin` is their fork, so no
query would say which ids Morpheus has issued. On collision the seconds field steps forward, so a
fan-out gets `:34 :35 :36 :37` and ordering survives. **Name the slug like a branch.** `morpheus pm new roadmap "<title>" --slug update-roadmap-ids`
— verb-noun, two to four words, ≤ 32 characters. It is a handle, not a summary: the description
belongs in the title and body, and the id above it is already unique, so the slug does not have
to be. Omitting `--slug` derives one from the title, which is a fallback rather than the intent —
"Roadmap ids become timestamps, not a coordinated integer" derives to
`roadmap-ids-become-timestamps` where `update-roadmap-ids` says as much in half the space.

Items migrated from the old integer scheme read `MO-26-07-29-045`: their own creation date plus the
old number, so `grep MO-045` still resolves against git history that cannot be rewritten.

`morpheus pm migrate-ids` also **repoints structured references** — `roadmap:` in worklog
frontmatter, which a tool would otherwise fail to resolve. Prose mentions are left alone
deliberately: the number is still in the new id, and rewriting narrative in a historical record
edits the past rather than repairing a link.

**Goals and requests are still sequential**, and for those `pm new` allocates against the remote
as well as the item files, because the files only hold ids that have already merged — an id
another session holds sits on its branch and nowhere else. If `origin` cannot be reached it still
allocates, but says so; treat that id as provisional until `pm claim` accepts it.

**Never create the branch by hand.** `pm claim` derives it from the item id, so the two cannot
disagree; hand-naming has already failed `check pr` twice by referencing an id that did not exist
yet.
Never start an item without claiming it; another agent, possibly on someone else's machine,
may be on it. Move the item to `review` when you open the PR. Merging deletes the branch and
releases the claim.

Use **one worktree per implementation task**, not per conversation. Read-only investigation
needs no new worktree. `pm claim <ID>` from a shared or unrelated checkout prepares a detached
worktree at freshly fetched trunk and prints its absolute path. It moves only that item's new,
untracked intake file; existing items come from trunk. Read the destination's records, refresh
context there, then repeat `pm claim` there to stake the branch. No receipt is copied automatically.
An already isolated detached worktree can claim directly after reading and refreshing.

Use `morpheus pm resume <ID>` to continue an explicitly named existing task. It reuses the
worktree holding its claimed branch, or checks out that branch in a worktree when needed.
Preserve its commits and edits; fetch and integrate trunk explicitly when behind. A resumed session
must not silently attach an unrelated request to its old task. Provider session IDs associate
sessions with tasks; `--session-id` on claim/resume supplies one explicitly (Codex defaults to
`CODEX_THREAD_ID`). Without an ID, the currently checked-out claimed branch identifies the task.
Do not run concurrent authors on the same task worktree.

**A request arriving in a conversation is intake, not a release path.** Messages, Slack, email,
voice and browser chat enter the same lifecycle as every other request: create or link the roadmap
item, claim it, work on its branch, test it, open a PR and merge it. A trusted author can authorize
the work; the channel cannot waive the records or review path. Never edit or release directly from
a conversation transcript.

**An external mutation ships with an exact target and proof.** Prefer a pasted one-shot CLI command
with explicit account, project and full resource identifiers; console prose is fallback only. Put
the caller-perspective verification probe and expected result beside the mutation. Upload, archive
or deploy success proves delivery, not acceptance: close the item only with evidence of the
requested user-visible result. Release jobs must depend on
`cpheinrich/morpheus/.github/workflows/release-preflight.yml@main` and check out its `sha` output.
Do not extract a recurring production probe until a second project needs the same one.

**When you hit real ambiguity, block — do not guess:**

```sh
morpheus pm block MO-051 --needs "which model, and whose subscription pays for it"
morpheus pm unblock MO-051    # once answered
```

This sets `status: blocked` and `needs:` on the item, writes a worklog entry, raises an open
`❗` item in the inbox, then commits and pushes those records on the claimed branch. Online it
refuses the protected trunk before writing anything; the explicitly
offline path may write locally there because it never commits or pushes. **Escalating is cheap;
shipping half-baked is expensive** — a plausible guess costs far more to discover later than a
question costs to ask now.

`needs` is required by the schema when an item is blocked, so say what would actually unblock you.
"Blocked on Chris" is not an answer; "which model, and whose subscription pays for it" is.

**A blocked item keeps its branch** — the partial work is on it, and blocked work holds no lane in
the heartbeat's ceiling. So resuming is a checkout, not a fresh claim; `pm claim` will refuse and
print exactly this:

```sh
morpheus pm resume MO-051
# In the reported worktree, after reading current records:
morpheus pm unblock MO-051
```

Do not open a PR from the blocked branch: it must retain the partial work. If the block records
need to land on trunk, copy them to a records branch that stakes no item (for example
`inbox-YYYY-MM-DD`). `check pr` names this route and explicitly refuses the tempting but false
answer of changing the item to `review`.

**Browser-reachable work is not blocked.** If the only thing standing between you and finishing is
that something has to happen in a browser — a console to click through, a dashboard to read, a
setting to verify — **do it yourself.** Do not stop and describe what someone should click. This
has cost hours repeatedly: work parked, a human asked, and then the same agent clearing it in a
minute once told to try.

The boundary is about obstacles, not gates. Where a human is wanted for **judgment** — spending,
publishing, sending, granting access — the gate stands and the browser being where it happens
changes nothing. The rule applies only when browser use is the *single, entire* obstacle.

**Build vs. borrow — check before writing a generic module.** Before implementing any capability
that is not specific to this product's domain — parsing, diffing, scheduling, retries, rate
limiting, fuzzy search, date handling, CLI plumbing — make one quick search of the ecosystem's
registry for a maintained package that already solves it. If a credible candidate appears, check
its last publish and dependency footprint before deciding.

**Propose, don't decide silently — in either direction.** If a credible package exists, say so
before building: an ❗ inbox item when the choice shapes the architecture, a line in the PR body
("considered X, built instead because Y" / "adopted X, N deps, maintained") when it is small.
Silently building what a package solves and silently adopting a heavy dependency are the same
mistake.

**Prefer lightweight.** Zero-to-few dependencies beats featureful; a framework pulled in to save
60 lines is worse than the 60 lines. Build when the need is small — roughly under 100 lines —
genuinely domain-specific, or every candidate is unmaintained. Record the outcome in
`.agent/decisions.md` so the choice is not relitigated next session.

**The authoring agent owns the entire review loop.** After committing implementation/tests,
run `morpheus review prepare --base origin/main`; this prints a review packet and does not
launch a reviewer. The authoring agent must spawn one fresh reviewer subagent/session with
repository access and that packet, without inheriting the author's conversation history.
The reviewer returns findings to the author; the author manages fixes, any allowed follow-up,
the review record, CI, and merge. Do not wait for a PR monitor, another standing agent, or
GitHub Actions to start this review. CI checks the evidence; it does not perform the review.
If the runner cannot start an independent session, report that concrete limitation and keep
the PR open with auto-merge disabled; never substitute self-review or assume a monitor will act.

**Independent review is required before merge.**
Respond once; substantive findings require one follow-up by the same reviewer. Minor-only findings
allow author fixes without a second pass. Unresolved disagreements or incomplete review keep the PR
open and auto-merge disabled. Record the review paragraph and structured evidence in the task
worklog, link it with a visible `review-record:` PR-body line, then apply `agent-reviewed`.
`review.required` defaults to true; project false opts out visibly. Only the named worklog may
change after the covered commit. Follow the [review contract](docs/runbooks/independent-review.md)
for budgets, related-code scope, record fields and escalation.

**Every PR must carry:**

- Tests for anything testable — a source change with no test change needs an explicit reason,
  and see **What makes a test count** below, because "a test exists" is not the bar
- A documentation update when behaviour or a public API changes
- A test plan: what you verified and how
- Any open questions you could not resolve, stated plainly rather than guessed at
- The roadmap item moved to `review`
- `Closes #<number>` for every GitHub issue declared in the roadmap item's `issues:` field
- For changed paths declared by `review.visualEvidence` in `morpheus.json`, a screen recording
  attached under `## Visual evidence` when practical, otherwise screenshots

The visual-evidence gate is a deterministic repository-owned path contract, not an attempt to
infer whether rendered pixels changed. CI validates the presence of either a GitHub attachment or
an HTTPS URL under a repository-approved `allowedUrlPrefixes` location, without fetching it; a
human or independent reviewer still decides whether the evidence actually demonstrates the change.
Declare the narrowest stable prefix that owns the media, such as a specific bucket path rather than
all of `storage.googleapis.com`. A repository may opt out only with `enabled: false` and a
substantive `reason` in its manifest. A legacy manifest with no declaration warns rather than blocks
until its explicit rollout commit lands.

When an issue becomes roadmap work, create it with `morpheus pm new roadmap "<title>" --issue 123`.
For an existing item, use `morpheus pm link-issue <ID> 123`. Both write structured closure intent
into the item. `check pr` then requires GitHub's closing keyword in the PR body, so merging the
fix cannot leave the issue open as a second, stale backlog.
An issue merely mentioned as related is not declared and is not closed.

**Except a PR that only touches records** — `hq/team/` and `.agent/`. An inbox cycle belongs to
no feature and has no item to move. Branch it as `inbox-<YYYY-MM-DD>`, staking no id, and
`check pr` will not ask for one.

**Meeting notes are delivered in isolated PRs.** Put each note on an `inbox-<YYYY-MM-DD>` branch,
staking no id, in a PR that contains only the factual, canonical meeting record. Roadmap changes,
strategy refinement, implementation work, decision promotion, and any other follow-up
interpretation go in separate PRs. When a follow-up PR files roadmap items, it backfills their ids
into the note's `roadmap:` field as bookkeeping.

**Never borrow an unrelated item's branch for this.** Merging a branch that stakes an id marks
that item shipped, so a PR which changes only records and `hq/product/` bookkeeping is refused on
a claimed branch — it demonstrably did not do that item's work. That is how MO-010 came to read as
shipped against a PR that only moved the inbox, and a shipped item is never looked at again.

When the deliverable genuinely *is* the record — a decision item like MO-003, whose whole outcome
was "do not publish, use a git dependency" — put `records-only: <reason>` in the PR body, the same
shape as `skip-tests:`.

**Both waivers are reported, not swallowed.** They are your own say-so about your own PR, so
`check pr` prints them as `~ waived` with the reason attached and never says "conventions
satisfied" without listing them. They still pass — the reason just has to be visible to whoever
reads the check.

**A waiver needs a real reason.** `skip-tests: yes` is refused, as are `true`, `n/a` and an empty
value. Say what cannot be tested and why.

**Before opening a PR**, run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm compile && pnpm morpheus pm index`,
and commit any one-time roadmap README migration or generated goal/request index changes. The
roadmap README is static after that migration. CI runs the same checks and will fail otherwise.

### What makes a test count

*"Tests for anything testable"* is satisfied by a test that would pass whatever the code did, and
that is the common failure rather than an exotic one. A project repository hit it on the module
its own documentation listed as "working and tested":

```python
def test_sharpe_ratio_positive():
    curve = [Decimal(str(100 + i)) for i in range(253)]   # monotonically rising
    assert sr > 0                                          # any positive number passes
```

At 87% line coverage, mutation testing showed that adding the risk-free rate instead of
subtracting it, dividing by the annualization factor instead of multiplying, and counting flat
periods as downside **all passed the suite**. The one test in that file which pinned a number was
the one test whose mutant died.

**Assert the value, not the sign.** A test that would still pass if the answer were wrong is not
a test, whatever it does to the coverage percentage. `> 0`, `!= 0`, `is not None` and "did not
raise" are shapes to be suspicious of — legitimate sometimes, and worth a second look every time.

**Test a guard at its boundary.** `x <= 0` and `x < 0` differ at exactly zero and nowhere else, so
a guard exercised only with `-1` is not exercised.

**A comment saying "never do X" needs a test that fails when X is done.** An invariant stated only
in prose is a convention; one with a test behind it is a constraint, and the difference is
invisible until someone breaks it.

**Coverage is a floor against deletion, not evidence of quality.** Gate it under the measured
number so it catches tests being removed, and do not raise it as a proxy for the suite getting
better — that is the metric being chased rather than the property being bought. `python-ci.yml`
defaults `coverage-fail-under` to 0 for the same reason.

**To check rather than assume, run mutation testing** — break the source, run the suite, see what
it fails to notice. Keep it out of CI: it is slow, and a mutation score turned into a gate gets
chased exactly like a coverage target. Read survivors instead of counting them, because a mutant
survives for three reasons and only the first is a test gap:

1. nothing tests that behaviour — write the test;
2. the mutation changes nothing observable — an equivalent mutant, and every codebase has some;
3. something else refuses first — defence in depth, so the guard is untested but the system is
   safe, which is the thing to write down.

A cheap proxy that costs one AST walk: **assertions per test**. In the audit above, the file with
the lowest density in the suite was the file with the worst mutation score.

Worked example, with the harness, the findings and the two mistakes made while fixing them:
[`qa/audits/2026-08-19-python-test-quality.md`](https://github.com/cpheinrich/lakinacapital/blob/main/qa/audits/2026-08-19-python-test-quality.md)
and [`qa/mutation/`](https://github.com/cpheinrich/lakinacapital/tree/main/qa/mutation) in Lakina.

## iOS projects

**Local iOS testing: focused tests only.** Run tests covering the feature under development
and directly affected features or shared dependencies. Do not run the full iOS test suite
locally unless Chris explicitly requests it: CI runs the full suite and must pass before
merge. Use the repository's build/test wrapper when available, with explicit test filters.
In the PR test plan and worklog, record the actual focused commands and why that scope was
selected. Continue adding or updating tests and performing relevant simulator/visual QA.

New projects inherit this policy from `src/init/templates.ts`; keep that template aligned.

## Branch protection

`main` is protected on Morpheus and every project repo. **Never push to `main`** — work on a
branch, open a PR, and merge it yourself once checks pass. Chris does not need to merge for you.

Do not wait on checks by polling. Two better options:

```sh
gh pr merge <n> --squash --auto --delete-branch   # merges itself when checks go green
gh pr checks <n> --watch --fail-fast              # blocks until they finish, then decide
```

Prefer `--auto` — it hands the merge to GitHub so the session is not held open waiting, and a
failing check simply leaves the PR unmerged rather than merging something broken. Use `--watch`
only when the next step depends on the merge having landed.

**Finish the author-managed independent review before enabling auto-merge.** Opening a PR,
pushing commits, or changing labels never starts a reviewer session. Follow the
[review contract](docs/runbooks/independent-review.md), return to the original reviewer for the
one permitted follow-up when required, and publish complete evidence before merging.

**Legacy GitHub review is opt-in.** Only repositories explicitly enabling the old
`agent-review.yml` run a model when a PR opens or a collaborator requests `@claude` re-review.
Its `agent-review / delivery` check may remain skipped to satisfy existing branch protection;
skipped delivery is not an independent review. A legacy `review-waived:` line applies only to
that delivery job and cannot waive the independent-review requirement.

Read and respond to any GitHub review findings as well, explaining declined findings in their
threads before resolving them. Unresolved substantive independent findings keep the PR open.
**Never merge with `--admin`** or use a delivery waiver to bypass independent review.

**`pm claim` reconciles the board first**, marking merged work shipped and recording its PR number,
so those status changes ride along in the claim commit. Nothing else advances an item to `shipped`,
and a board that lags reality stops being read — thirteen items had drifted before anyone noticed.

Running it after a merge instead leaves the status change in a dirty working tree on protected
`main` with nowhere to go, which is how a housekeeping step gets quietly dropped. `morpheus pm ship`
still exists for running it deliberately, and `morpheus pm ship <ID>` for work that shipped without
a PR it can see.

It confirms against a merged PR rather than inferring from a missing branch, and writes nothing when
`gh` is unavailable. It also reports merged branches that were never deleted — those read as live
claims and would make `pm claim` refuse the item forever.

**Append a worklog entry** to `.agent/worklog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` before opening a PR. Record
what you learned, especially dead ends that produced no code — git history cannot capture those.

**At the start of a session** read `.agent/decisions.md` and `.agent/learned.md` — see
[`.agent/README.md`](.agent/README.md) for how the four records relate. Decisions are
settled choices — if one looks wrong, say so and ask rather than quietly working around it.

## The inbox cycle

`hq/team/<handle>.md` is how a human and their agents exchange state. These are the only
files a human is expected to edit.

**One inbox per person, not per session.** A person's file collects items from every agent
working for them, each heading tagged with the agent that raised it (`` `claude` ``,
`` `codex` ``). Two agents share a working copy so writes serialise; two *people* never touch
the same file, so git never merges a status.

1. I write it at the end of a working session: **a prose summary of what got done first**, then
   numbered items, each ending in a `~`. Summary-before-blockers is the order a human expects.
2. He replies inline after the `~`, leaving the marker in place.
3. On my next turn I: read the replies, act on them, promote anything durable to
   `.agent/decisions.md`, archive the whole exchange to
   `.agent/inbox-archive/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<handle>.md` (date first, so the archive reads as one timeline), and write a fresh inbox.

A cycle goes out on its own `inbox-<YYYY-MM-DD>` branch — see the records exception above.

**Markers.** Three, and the distinction matters because Chris scans rather than reads:

**Every item is either closed or open. Never both, never neither.**

**The state lives in the heading**, not inline — `❗` and `✅` carry colour, so scanning does not
depend on the renderer's text colour. Items are `##` with no wrapping section header, because
Nimbalyst dims each descending heading level.

| State | Shape |
|---|---|
| **Closed** | `## ✅ 2. Title · \`claude\`` → answer, **no reply slot** |
| **Open** | `## ❗ 1. Title · \`claude\`` → answer → **`~` on its own line** to reply into |

Two mistakes to avoid, both made in the first round:

1. **`❗` without a following `~`.** He has nowhere to answer. The `~` at the top of an item is
   his *previous* reply, not a fresh one.
2. **`✅` on an item that still asks a question.** If there is a question, it is open.

**An open item proposes options.** Where the item is a decision, give **three concrete options
and an `Other`**, one marked recommended and placed first, so replying is a selection rather than
a composition:

```markdown
## ❗ 3. Which way on the contact form? · `claude`

Delivery still calls Cloudflare's Email Sending API…

- **A — keep Cloudflare (recommended).** Works today, already in the stack, no new account.
- **B — move to Resend.** Removes the dependency; needs an account, a verified domain, a key.
- **C — drop the form.** Point people at the social links already on the page.
- **Other —** something else, or none of these is the right frame.

~
```

Chris's reply time is the bottleneck, not agent generation time, and an item demanding prose
spends the scarce resource to save the abundant one. The second reason matters more: **three real
options cannot be written without having done the analysis**, where a bare `~` lets an
under-examined question be handed over as though that were collaboration. Items get longer; that
is the trade.

**`Other` is structural, not decoration.** Options railroad — three plausible choices can hide
that the answer is a fourth thing, and a reader scanning quickly takes the least-bad rather than
noticing the frame is wrong. This is not hypothetical: a question went out as *"darwin and evo use
Vercel DNS — if so, cut over"* when they in fact use Cloudflare DNS pointed at Vercel. As three
Vercel-DNS-flavoured options, that false premise would have been *harder* to catch, since each
option would have quietly reasserted it.

So: **options only where the analysis is real.** Filler is worse than an honest open question. And
not every item is a decision — an FYI or a genuinely open-ended question takes a plain `~`.

`morpheus inbox validate` enforces both, plus dense numbering, the GitHub-handle rule, and a
summary before the first item. Run it before finishing; CI runs it too.

**Link roadmap items with relative markdown paths** — `[MO-011](product/roadmap/MO-011.md)`
from `hq/STATUS.md`. These resolve in Obsidian *and* render on GitHub, unlike `[[wikilinks]]`
which only work in Obsidian.

Keep **Needs you** as one list. Splitting "waiting on you" from "blocked" was a false
distinction — both mean the same thing to the person reading it.

Never let an inbox accumulate history. It is a snapshot; the archive is the record.

## Sharing Google links

**Always append `?authuser=<email>`** (or `&authuser=`) to any Google or Google Cloud URL —
console, Firebase, payments, admin. Without it the link opens under whichever identity the
account switcher last used, and switching loses the link context. Use the email address rather
than an index.

## Building a website

**When someone asks for a website — a landing page, email capture, a signup or contact form, or
the internal dashboard — run `morpheus web init` before writing any of it by hand.**

```sh
morpheus web status   # what the surface has, and what it is missing
morpheus web init     # add whatever is missing
```

It does the half `morpheus init` deliberately does not: it provisions the GCP project, Firebase,
Firestore (`nam5`), the registered web app, and the Workload Identity a Vercel deployment
authenticates as — then scaffolds the code that depends on those. A Next.js app when there is
none, **email waitlist capture**, and **`/hq` behind Google sign-in**, gated on the same `role`
custom claim that Firestore rules read.

Scaffolded projects carry this as the `website-init` skill, so an agent finds it at the moment it
is needed rather than by going looking for a CLI it has never run.

**It never overwrites**, the same contract as `init` — every existing file is skipped and
reported, which is what makes "create the website" and "add the missing half to a live site" one
command. It will not edit a working home page; it tells you where to render the form instead.
Three files are *merged* rather than skipped, because skipping them would leave the generated code
unable to resolve: the app's `package.json` dependencies, the shared package's `exports` map, and
the Firestore rules — and the rules block is inserted only above an anchor the tool can actually
find, never at a guessed position.

**The Firebase-dependent half is written only when a Firebase project is real.** With
`--no-provision`, or when provisioning is blocked, the waitlist and `/hq` are skipped and reported
rather than written against placeholder configuration. A sign-in page holding a placeholder
`firebaseConfig` looks finished and cannot work, which is the failure shape `learned.md` records
four times over.

Afterwards: `pnpm install`, render `<WaitlistForm source="hero" />` on the page, add a
`waitlist_joined` event to the project's analytics contract and pass it to the form's `onJoined`
prop, then `morpheus access sync` so the allowlist becomes the `role` claim. Until that sync runs,
a signed-in account has no role and `/hq` refuses it — the gate working, not a broken sign-in.

**When a project wants people to sign themselves up, run `morpheus web add-consumer-auth`** — do
not hand-build Firebase auth. It extends `web init` with what Evo shipped and hardened
(cpheinrich/morpheus#135): a second Firebase project for staging with **staging as the default**
(only a Vercel Production build reaches production data), the auth plumbing whose review findings
are already encoded (login CSRF, the enumeration-oracle-proof reset route, the backslash open
redirect, the cross-device verification remint), starter sign-in/sign-up/reset/action pages, and
**three test suites that run against the Firebase emulators with no secrets** — wired into CI via
the reusable `firebase-tests.yml`. `--check` reports drift between a project's shared auth files
and the current templates. The console half — providers, authorized domains, the service-account
key scoped to Vercel Preview *only*, mail keys, the staging domain — is
[`docs/runbooks/consumer-auth.md`](docs/runbooks/consumer-auth.md).

`--no-provision` skips the cloud entirely; the provisioning half is what makes `web init` a
context-gated command, and the scaffolding half is not gated at all.

## Firebase Google sign-in bootstrap

**Do not call Firebase-ready just because the project, SDK config, or Auth tab exists.** Immediately
after an agent creates a Firebase project for a web/HQ surface, run:

```sh
morpheus firebase auth setup --project <firebase-project> --domain <public-origin>
```

The command writes the Google-provider configuration into `firebase.json`, deploys it with the
Firebase CLI, adds the app's authorized domain through the Firebase API, and verifies both remote
facts. It first tries the existing `gcloud` and Firebase CLI sessions. If either needs an interactive
Google authorization, the CLI launches its browser flow; if a Firebase consent/ToS screen still
blocks deployment, it opens Firebase Authentication and fails with the exact recovery step. Use
`morpheus firebase auth check` in a later session or CI to fail closed rather than rediscovering a
disabled provider or missing custom domain from a spinning sign-in screen. Successful setup records
the normalized origin and user-visible OAuth support identity as `publicDomain` and `supportEmail`
in `morpheus.json`; pass `--domain` explicitly on the first run. The check refuses to call an app
ready when it cannot determine that origin. Declare legitimate preview or secondary Auth hosts in
`authorizedDomains` as bare hostnames; the command reports any other remote domains for manual
review instead of silently retaining or automatically revoking them.

## Folder documentation

**A folder gets a `README.md` when an agent could plausibly do the wrong thing without it.**
Concretely, when any of these is true:

| Trigger | Example |
|---|---|
| It is an **input to something** | `hq/` feeds the dashboard; `qa/acceptance/` feeds verifier rung 3 |
| It has a **convention filenames do not reveal** | worklog naming, inbox markers, id formats |
| It is **generated**, or partly | `hq/product/goals/README.md`, the role helpers in `firestore.rules` |
| It is a **seam** | shared packages, kit boundaries, anywhere two projects meet |

**Not** for framework-standard directories — `app/`, `components/`, `__tests__/` — whose meaning
is universal. A README restating the folder name is noise that can also go stale.

**Keep them short, and point rather than repeat.** Three lines and a link into `architecture.md`
beats a second copy of the reasoning. Locality is what a README buys: eight lines where an agent
is standing beat 1,400 lines in another repo. Two copies of the same explanation drift, so depth
stays in one place.

This exists because a `/hq` dashboard was built that did not match the folder structure it was
rendering. The explanation existed — in `architecture.md`, in another repo — and the agent never
reached it.

**A tool reads the filesystem, not the README.** If a dashboard derives its sections from prose,
the README has quietly become a config file that looks like documentation, and the two will
disagree. The README explains *intent* to a reader; code reads *reality*.

`morpheus init` scaffolds these for the directories it creates. It is a convention, not a check —
a check that demands a file gets a file, and the result is stubs written to satisfy the check.

## Style

Match the surrounding code. This codebase favours:

- Small, single-purpose modules with named exports
- Explicit types at boundaries; inference inside
- Errors surfaced as data (`ParseIssue[]`) rather than thrown, so one bad input cannot abort a
  batch — see `src/pm/parse.ts`
- Comments that explain *why*, not *what*. The YAML-date preprocessing in `src/pm/schema.ts` is
  the model: it exists because YAML silently converts unquoted dates, and that is not obvious.

## Things that have bitten us

- **YAML converts unquoted `2026-07-01` into a Date object.** Frontmatter dates go through
  `isoDate`, which normalises both forms.
- **A colon in a title breaks YAML.** `pm new` quotes scalars defensively; hand-written
  frontmatter with a colon must be quoted.
- Generated files (`hq/product/*/README.md` between the `morpheus:` markers) are never edited by
  hand. Change the item files and regenerate.

## Shared Git sync routine for Claude and Codex

This section records Robbie's authorized Mac workflow. It does not schedule jobs on other contributors' computers or replace this repository's task, review, testing, or release requirements.

- GitHub is the shared source for committed code. Chat histories, unpushed edits, ignored files, and local databases are not synchronized by this routine. Never add secrets to Git to make them sync; repositories intentionally holding credentials retain their stricter handling rules.
- Before coding, inspect the current branch, working-tree status, and worktrees; fetch the configured remote and identify its default branch (`main` or `master`). Follow an existing project's canonical-trunk and task-claim procedure where present. Do not rewrite a fork's remote or merge upstream into it as part of this routine.
- Keep the normal default-branch checkout clean. Update it only when idle and free of tracked/untracked changes and in-progress Git operations, using a fast-forward-only merge of its remote default branch. If dirty, divergent, on a task branch, or in active use, leave its files alone and report the blocker.
- Work on one isolated branch/worktree per task. Claude and Codex must not edit the same worktree concurrently. Resume an existing task through the project's prescribed workflow rather than replacing its branch. Use required claim tools in Morpheus-managed projects.
- After work, run the required checks, commit only the task's files, push the task branch, and open or update its PR. Report whether it is open or merged. Follow all project review and merge requirements; this routine does not authorize merging unrelated PRs or deploying applications.
- Robbie authorized one Mac sync every day at **8 a.m. America/New_York**. The existing Codex automation owns that schedule; these instructions alone do not install a scheduler. It fetches registered repositories and fast-forwards only clean, idle default-branch checkouts. Feature branches, active tasks, and unfinished edits are skipped. If activity cannot be established, fetch only. This is the narrow, explicit exception to any general prohibition on unsolicited timer jobs; do not create additional polling jobs.
- Never automatically stash, reset, clean, force-push, switch task branches, or discard files to make a sync succeed. The scheduled run must not install dependencies, restart services, or deploy. Report successful updates or new actionable failures once; stay quiet when already current or when a previously reported blocker is unchanged.
